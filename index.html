		<p>
			Welcome to Acourant,

Acourant builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other in the neighbourhood, build communities and grow businesses. 

These Terms and Conditions govern your use of Acourant and its related products, features, services and technologies, except where it explicitly states that separate terms and conditions apply. 
Acourant is free to use for its related products, features and technologies covered by these Terms and conditions. 
Acourant does not use your personal data and does not share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with anyone unless you provide specific permission. 

You can also go to your profile page at any time to review the privacy choices. 
Curently Acourant is a startup hence services are funded internally.

Your commitments, 
    Use the same name that you use in everyday life;
    Provide accurate information about yourself;
    Create only one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes; and
    do not give access to your account to others.
You cannot use Acourant if:
    You are under the minimum legal age in your country,
    You are a convicted sex offender,
    We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms or Policies,
    You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

What you can share and do:
Acourant wants people to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of the community. 

You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so),
    You may not use Acourant to do or share anything:
      	That breaches these Terms and Conditions that apply to your use of Acourant.
    	That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.
    	That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.
    	You may not upload viruses or malicious code, or do anything that could disable, overburden or impair the proper working or appearance of Acourant.
    	You may not access or collect data from Acourant using automated means (without prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access.

Acourant can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions.
If Acourant removes content that you have shared in violation of the Community standards, Acourant lets you know the options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose Acourant or others to legal liability; harm the community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of the services; or where its prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

To help support our community of users, Acourant encourages you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and conditions.

You provide the following permissions: 
    Permission to use content that you create and share: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.
    You own the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Acourant.
    Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content.
    However, to provide the services, Acourant needs you to give some legal permissions (known as a â€˜licence') to use this content. 
    This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving the services

    Specifically, when you post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with Acourant, you grant a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). 

This means, for example, that if you share a photo, video or text, you give Acourant permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings).  
       This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.
       You can delete content individually, when you delete content, it's no longer visible to other users; however, it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:
        Immediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations;
        your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case, this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
        Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
        investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of Terms and Conditions (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of Acourant);
        comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency; 
        in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
    	In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.
    
Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with content: 
You give Acourant permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Acourant next to or in connection with content, offers that we display, without any compensation to you. 

Permission to update software that you use or download: If you download or use Acourant software, you provide permission to download and install updates to the software where available. 

Limits on using Acourant intellectual property
If you use the content covered by intellectual property rights that has been made available for you, Acourant retains all rights to that content. 
You can only use Acourant copyrights or trademarks with prior written permission. 
You must obtain written permission to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from Acourant. 

Additional provisions
1. Updating our Terms and conditions,
Acourant works constantly to improve the services and develop new features for you and community. As a result, Acourant may need to update these Terms and conditions from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. Acourant will only make changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests.
Acourant will notify you at least 5 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated Terms and conditions are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use Acourant.
We hope that you will continue using Acourant, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and conditions and no longer want to be part of the Acourant, you can suspend your account usage at any time.
2. Account suspension or termination
We want Acourant to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.
If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms and conditions, including in particular Acourant Standards, Acourant may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. 
Acourant may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.
Where Acourant takes such action, you will be notified and explain any options that you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose Acourant or others to legal liability; harm users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of the services; or where Acourant is restricted due to technical limitations; or where Acourant is  prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact Acourant if you think that Acourant has disabled your account by mistake.
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and Acourant.

Limits on liability
Acourant works hard to provide the best services and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. 
Acourant, however, is provided "as is", and Acourant makes no guarantees that they will always be safe, secure or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, Acourant also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Acourant does not control or direct what people and others do or say, and not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content that they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful and other objectionable content).
Acourant cannot predict when issues may arise with the Product. Accordingly, liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstances will Acourant be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms and conditions, even if Acourant has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Disputes
Acourant tries to provide clear rules so that Acourant can limit or hopefully avoid disputes with you. 

If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.
If you are a consumer, the laws of the Republic of India will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against Acourant that arises out of or relates to these Terms and conditions, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the City Civil Court, Bengaluru. 
You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of this court for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the Republic of India will govern these Terms and conditions and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. 

These Terms and conditions make up the entire agreement between you and Acourant, regarding your use of the Product. They supersede any prior agreements.
Some of the features that Acourant offers are also governed by supplemental Terms and conditions. 
     
If you post or share content containing video and music, you must comply with the Video Guidelines. To the extent that any supplemental Terms and conditions that conflict with these Terms and conditions, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
    If any portion of these Terms and conditions is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. 
If Acourant fails to enforce any of these Terms and conditions, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms and conditions must be made in writing and signed by Acourant.
    You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms and conditions to anyone else without prior consent.
    You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account. Only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account.
    These Terms and conditions do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All the rights and obligations under these Terms and conditions are freely assignable by Acourant in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
    You should know that the username for your account in certain circumstances may be changed (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name that you use in everyday life). Acourant will inform you in advance if this has to be done and explain why.
    Acourant always appreciates your feedback and other suggestions. But you should know that this may be used without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and Acourant is under no obligation to keep them confidential.
    Acourant reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

Video Guidelines:
You are responsible for the content you post.
People use Acourant to share content with family, friends and their neighbourhood. Keep in mind you remain solely responsible for the content that you post, including any music that features in that content. Nothing in these terms constitutes any authorization by Acourant.

Use of video with music for commercial or non-personal purposes in particular is prohibited unless you have obtained appropriate licenses.  Unauthorized content may be removed
If you post content owned by someone else, your content may be blocked, or may be reviewed by the applicable rights owner and removed if your use of that video is not properly authorized.
